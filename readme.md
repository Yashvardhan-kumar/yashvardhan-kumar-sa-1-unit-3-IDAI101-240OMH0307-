 MindPatch – Digital Detox & Wellness Planner

 Project Overview
MindPatch is an AIassisted digital wellness and detox planner designed to help students maintain healthy digital habits and emotional wellbeing. The app focuses on gentle nudges, selfawareness, and habitbuilding rather than strict restrictions, making digital balance more approachable and sustainable for young users.

This project was developed as part of the Critical & Creative Thinking – Summative Assessment under the Artificial Intelligence course.


 Problem Statement
Students experience increasing digital fatigue, stress, and emotional imbalance due to prolonged screen usage. Many existing solutions are either too restrictive or lack emotional personalization.

MindPatch addresses this gap by offering a calm, supportive, and usercentered wellness experience that promotes balance without pressure.



 Key Features
 Mood Logging: Simple mood tracking using emojis and sliders  
 ScreenTime Input: Manual input of daily screen usage  
 AI Detox Planner (Simulated): Rulebased personalized break suggestions  
 Gratitude Journal: Space for daily reflections  
 Habit Tracker & Rewards: Streaks and rewards to encourage healthy routines  



 AI Logic (Simulated)
MindPatch uses a simulated, rulebased AI logic to demonstrate decisionmaking. No real AI model or backend system is implemented.

 Inputs
 Mood score  
 Screentime duration  
 Time of day  
 Habit consistency  

 Example Rules
 If mood is low and screen time is high → Suggest a longer break  
 If mood is neutral and screen time is moderate → Suggest a short wellness activity  
 If mood is positive and screen time is low → Provide positive reinforcement  

The system adapts suggestions over time based on user responses and usage patterns.

 User Testing & Improvements
The prototype was tested with multiple users to evaluate usability and clarity. Based on feedback, improvements were made to navigation, readability, and reward visibility to enhance user experience.


 Ethical Considerations
 No sensitive personal data is collected  
 Screentime input remains manual  
 No forced restrictions are imposed  
 User autonomy and privacy are prioritized  



 Project Impact
MindPatch promotes selfawareness, emotional balance, and responsible digital habits among students. The app demonstrates how AIdriven logic and humancentered design can be combined to create supportive and ethical digital wellness solutions.
